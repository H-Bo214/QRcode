## 🧐About

This a front-end challenge from Frontend Mentor. The challenge was to recreate the comp provided. I decided to take things a little further and make a functioning QR code generator. The comp was modified to include an input field, button and a message informing the user that their code has been generated.
<br/>

## 💡Features

- Enter any valid URL and generate a QR code.
- Mobile friendly design
  <br/>

## ⛏️Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- qrcodejs

## 🏁Getting Started

## 🗓Planning, challenges and future improvements

I began planning out this project by reviewing the QRcodejs documentation. From there, I drew out the HTML structure based on the provided comp and began coding the application.
