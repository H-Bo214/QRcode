## 🧐About

This a front-end challenge from Frontend Mentor. The challenge was to recreate the comp provided. I decided to take things a little further and make a functioning QR code generator. The comp was modified to include an input field, button and a message informing the user their code has been generated.

## 🗓Planning, challenges and future improvements

I began planning out this project by reviewing the QRcodejs documentation. From there, I drew out the HTML structure based on the provided comp and began coding the application.
